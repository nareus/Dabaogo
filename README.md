# Motivation

As students staying in Tembusu, we would usually have to walk out to either Fine Foods or Food Clique to grab a quick meal during lunchtime. While this may seem like a reasonable task, it can be a hassle when there are exams around the corner or when we are really busy with schoolwork and other activities.

During these situations, we often resort to troubling our friends to help us buy lunch. However, based on our personal experience, they are usually either not available due to schoolwork or they have already bought lunch. This causes the inconvenience of us rushing down ourselves to get what we want, which can waste a lot of precious time. How can we solve the problem that wastes everyone’s time?

What about food delivery services like Grab or WhyQueue?

For starters, Grab does not list Fine Foods or Food Clique as stores that we can order from, making it impossible for students to order their beloved Mala from Food Clique or, our personal favorite, Chili Oil Noodles from the Xiao Long Bao store from Fine Foods. Moreover, Grab’s delivery fees are usually 3 to 5 dollars during the normal time, according to moneysmart.sg. Such a high delivery cost makes it uneconomical to buy lunch for a single person. Sure, you could ask your level mates to buy food together to share the cost but if they have already bought food, we would be back to square one. Additionally, it is inconvenient to organise a group buy every single day.

On the other hand, Why Queue enables users to buy food from Food Clique and Fine Foods and even get the food delivered for free, to begin with, to qualify for free delivery, a user has to order the food in advance. Often, students do not think about what they want to eat until it is time for lunch, and if they forget to plan in advance, they would potentially have to go out and get their own food.

As such, through an application like Dabaogo, we believe that our application where users can get food at a potentially faster speed and also profit by buying food for themselves and others can really change the way NUS students get their meals.

# Project Scope

We aim to make a food delivery application where users themselves can help buy food for other users and make some profit by doing so. The people bringing food for others are called food transporters, as they are the ones transporting the meals from eateries to the residences. The users buying the food are known as buyers. A student can be both a buyer and a food transporter at different times using the same account. We believe in making this transition as seamless as possible as we do not want a distinction in identifying between these two roles.

The benefit for the buyers is that they can order food from NUS conveniently and with lower delivery costs. The food transporters benefit by receiving a small of money (around one dollar) for every person they help.

The app will be designed in a similar manner to other food delivery apps, with login/registration, ordering, payment, and order tracking features. However, we also build in features for the food transporters such as selecting locations and tracking orders.

# User Stories

1. As an NUS student, I want to get some pocket money by just helping my peers from the same residence buy lunch from the food court that I am already going to.
2. As a student who is usually very busy with work, I want to get my meals delivered by my residential peers by just paying a little more than usual.
3. As a student who likes to have a drink along with my meals, I want to afford to pay for it without spending any of my own money by helping others buy meals.
4. As a student who likes to meet new people, I want to make new friends by delivering food to people at my residence who I have never met before.
5. As a student who is concerned about covid transmissions, I want this app to decrease the crowd at NUS dining areas significantly which reduces the risk of covid transmissions.
6. As a student, I want to provide a helping hand to my busier residential mates by bringing them lunch when I go down to eat.

# Survey Results

We have sent a survey to around 50 students to identify the key feature and benefits that this app could potentially bring. This section will list down some of the insights that we have discovered which will help us in deciding the functionalities of the app.

There is a large business opportunity during lunch as more than 90 percent of the people indicated that they have the habit of going out for lunch. There is also a significant amount who go for breakfast and dinner but the numbers are far lesser since most residences have breakfast and dinner catered already.

We are Expecting food transporters in the morning and night would be pretty low. Put higher prices for breakfast and dinner to incentivize people to be food transporters then.

The majority of people indicate that they get someone else to pick up food for them when they are not able to go down. Thus, we can incorporate this habit that already exists through our app, and also incentivize more people to help get food through the delivery fees. Since people already have this habit it would be easier to get them to use our application.

A large majority are willing to be food transporters, which shows that there is a good chance that there will be users available to buy food for others. Additionally, there is a significant proportion of people who are willing to pay an extra amount to buy food for them which indicates a potential need for students in residences that this app can fulfill.
